description: "Welcome to Reach Docs, where you will find relevant information to help you start deploying instances on the Reach infrastructure created by the Reach Team and, for obvious reasons, on all related services within the infrastructure. You will learn the basic principles of use and, gradually, information that will help you customize your experience."

## Quickstart

To begin using the infrastructure, you must have a license key, which can be obtained once you have paid for a plan. If you have not made a prior payment, please consult the pricing page.

Once you have chosen the plan that best suits your needs, you will receive your license key. This is essential, as it allows you to verify your identity in the various Reach administrator systems. Your license key should look something like this:

```
REACHX-XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX
```

## Using ReachX Dashboard

ReachX Dashboard is a tool powered by the Reach infrastructure that allows you to manage your organizations focused on distributing experiences in Minecraft. It allows you to maintain control over the users within them, manage data, and ensure the integrity of the experiences.
